## Description:
This project is a minimalist JavaScript bundler built from scratch to demonstrate the core concepts and functionalities 
of bundling in a simple and understandable manner. The purpose of this showcase is to provide a clear and concise example of how a bundler works,
making it accessible for beginners and those interested in understanding the inner workings of bundling.

## Key Features:

Dependency Resolution: Explore the process of analyzing JavaScript dependencies and creating a dependency graph.
Module Loading: Implement a module loading mechanism to handle import statements and resolve module dependencies.
Tree Shaking: Illustrate the concept of tree shaking to eliminate unused code and optimize the bundle size.
Transpilation: Integrate a basic JavaScript transpiler to transform modern JavaScript syntax into a compatible format.
Code Bundling: Bundle multiple JavaScript modules into a single file, enabling efficient loading and execution in the browser.
Sourcemap Generation: Implement sourcemap generation to enable easy debugging and source code mapping.
